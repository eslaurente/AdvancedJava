**airline-gwt** 


This is a web application that allows a user to add an airline and add invidivual flights information. The page updates a list of stored flights for that airline. The user can search for flights via source and destination airport codes and flight numbers with the page updating a result table. The user can select any item on the result table and delete the flight from storage.
